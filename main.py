''' Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array
is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.

For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 
the expected output would be: [120, 60, 40, 30, 24].

If the input was [3,2,1],
The output would be [2, 3, 6].

Follow-up: What if you can't use division? '''

arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
