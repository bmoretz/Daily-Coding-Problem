/* Draw Line.
 *
 * A monochrome screen is stored as a single array of bytes, allowing
 * eight consecutive pixels to be stored in one byte. The screen has
 * width w, where w is divisible by 8 (that is, no byte will be split
 * across rows). The height of the screen, of course, can be derived
 * from the length of the array and the width. Implement a function
 * that draws a horizontal line from (x1, y) to (x2, y).
 *
 * The method signature should look something like this:
 *
 * drawLine(byte[] screen, int width, int x1, int x2, int y)
